# Invoice-data-Extraction : Objective: Develop a Python application to extract key information from invoices using machine learning. The project involves training a model, optimizing it for deployment, and running it on a client desktop. The solution should handle various invoice formats in English, Dutch, and French without hardcoded labels, understanding the context to accurately extract information. 

In this project we created and extracted invoice dataset and perform vaisious approaches such as: 1.	Data Collection and Preprocessing
2.	Model Training
3.	Model Optimization
4.	Model Deployment
